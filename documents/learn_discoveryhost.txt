Discovery Host
-------------------------------------------------------
Use Command:

nmap -sn -PE -iL <Target IP List> --exclude <My IP Address> -oN <filename>.nmap -oX <filename>.xml

Option:
-sn (No port scan)
    This option tells Nmap not to do a port scan after host discovery, and only print out the available hosts that responded to the host discovery probes. 

-PE; -PP; -PM (ICMP Ping Types)
    Nmap sends an ICMP type 8 (echo request) packet to the target IP addresses, expecting a type 0 (echo reply) in return from available hosts. 

-iL (List Scan)
    The list scan is a degenerate form of host discovery that simply lists each host of the network(s) specified, without sending any packets to the target hosts.

--exclude <host1>[,<host2>[,...]] (Exclude hosts/networks)
    Specifies a comma-separated list of targets to be excluded from the scan even if they are part of the overall network range you specify. 

-oN <filespec> (normal output)
    Requests that normal output be directed to the given filename. 

-oX <filespec> (XML output)
    Requests that XML output be directed to the given filename.
