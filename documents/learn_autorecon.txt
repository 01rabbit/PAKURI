The scans directory is where all results from scans performed by AutoRecon will go. This includes port scans / service detection scans, as well as any service enumeration scans. It also contains two other files:

_commands.log:
    contains a list of every command AutoRecon ran against the target. This is useful if one of the commands fails and you want to run it again with modifications.

_manual_commands.txt:
    contains any commands that are deemed "too dangerous" to run automatically, either because they are too intrusive, require modification based on human analysis, or just work better when there is a human monitoring them.
    If a scan results in an error, a file called _errors.log will also appear in the scans directory with some details to alert the user.
    If output matches a defined pattern, a file called _patterns.log will also appear in the scans directory with details about the matched output.
    The scans/xml directory stores any XML output (e.g. from Nmap scans) separately from the main scan outputs, so that the scans directory itself does not get too cluttered.
